The parties that set third party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the Em@ney Plc website and when it visits certain other websites and/or mobile apps.

We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non? Personal information. However, to the extent that IP addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information.

In addition to cookies, we may use other similar technologies, like web beacons to track users of our Services. Web beacons, or &quot;clear gifs,&quot; are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. They are used to track the online movements of web users.

In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user&#39;s computer hard drive or device, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We and our third-party service provider employ web beacons for the reasons stated above (under &quot;Cookies&quot;), but primarily to help us better manage content on our Services by informing us which content is effective.

We may also use so-called &quot;Flash Cookies&quot; (also known as &quot;Local Shared Objects or &quot;LSOs&quot;) to collect and store information about your use of our services, fraud prevention and for other site operations.

### DOES EM@NEY PLC USE ADVERTISING COOKIES?

Em@ney Plc uses third party service providers to display advertising on our Services and serve advertising on other third-party sites that are more relevant to you or your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement, as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They remember that you have visited a website and this information may be shared with other organizations, such as advertisers. This means that after you have been to our websites, you may see some advertisements about our Services elsewhere on the Internet. The information collected through this process by the third-party service providers does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details or other personal information that directly identifies you unless you choose to provide these. Such advertising will only be delivered where permitted by applicable law.
